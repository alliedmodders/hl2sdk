* About *
*********
This version of the Source/Orange Box SDK attempts to remove as many
warnings as possible when compiling on Windows or Linux.
The -fpermissive option has been removed from the Linux makefiles and
-Wall has been added. It is also now possible to cross-compile the SDK
on 64-bit Linux systems with the addition of the -m32 option.

*********
* Notes *
*********
1: A Visual Studio project file for choreoobjects has been added to
   the choreoobjects directory for the convenience of recompiling this
   static library for Windows if it ever becomes necessary to do so.

2: Makefiles for choreoobjects, mathlib, and tier1 have been added to
   the linux_sdk directory for the convenience of recompiling these
   static libraries for Linux if it ever becomes necessary to do so.
   
3: The vmpi directory has been removed as it seems to be an exact copy
   of the one located in the utils directory. Nothing seems to depend
   upon the files within it yet.

****************
* Known Issues *
****************
1: The SDK will not compile with GCC 4.3. This will be addressed in a
   future update.
   
2: The SDK may not fully compile with Visual Studio 2008. This will be
   addressed in a future update.

3: The caption compiler which is located in utils/captioncompiler will
   not link due to a missing static library (appframework.lib).
